                    <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹, my full name is <span className='font-bold'>Si Ngurah Putu Juliarta</span>, I'm usually called Juli or Ngurah. I am a Web Developer and Student. I was born and live in Badung, Bali. Currently, I am a student at <span className='font-bold'>SMK NEGERI 1 DENPASAR</span> majoring in Software Engineering. I have a strong interest in the world of programming, especially in the field of web development. My journey in the world of web development started with HTML and CSS. At first, I was just dabbling, but as time went by, I realized that this world challenged and interested me. That's why I decided to dive into it. Now, I have developed my skills in several programming languages, including PHP and JavaScript. I have also learned several frameworks, such as Laravel, React.js, and Vue.js, which allow me to build more complex and dynamic web applications. </p>
                    <p>I am very enthusiastic to continue learning and developing my skills in the world of programming. If you have questions, want to use my services, or want to collaborate on a joint project, don't hesitate to contact me. I am always ready to learn and grow together.</p>
